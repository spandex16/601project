## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Pokemon}

Pokemon <- read_csv("C:/Users/notso/OneDrive/UoC-Data Science/D602/Project/Pokemon.csv")
#View(Pokemon)
summary(Pokemon)
str(Pokemon)
```

```{r}
Combat_Power <- function(attack, special_atk, defense, special_def, hp) {
  total_a <- attack + special_atk
  total_d <- defense + special_def
  numerator <- floor(total_a * (total_d^0.5) * (hp^0.5) * (0.667934^2))  # Assuming `math.floor` is similar to `floor` in R
  return(floor(max(10, numerator / 10)))
}

Pokemon <- Pokemon %>%
  mutate(isDragon = ifelse(Pokemon$`Type 1` == "Dragon" | Pokemon$`Type 2` == "Dragon", 1, 0)) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(CP = Combat_Power(Attack, `Sp. Atk`, Defense, `Sp. Def`, HP))

Pokemon <- Pokemon %>% mutate(CP = Combat_Power(Pokemon$Attack, Pokemon$`Sp. Atk`, Pokemon$Defense, Pokemon$`Sp. Def`, Pokemon$HP))


head(Pokemon)

```

```{r}
# Perform regression analysis
model <- lm(CP ~ Attack + Defense + HP + isDragon, data = Pokemon)

# Print regression summary
summary(model)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
